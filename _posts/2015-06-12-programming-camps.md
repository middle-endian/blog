When questioned as to why he wasn't using his time at camp to do node related things, Hume explained, "No-one does programming at a programming camp! It's an unspoken rule, like wearing a band's own merch to their concert. We're just a bunch of like minded individuals getting together to work on our side projects."

"I went to my first programming camp in 2005," Hume recalls, "I remember seeing a presentation from Apple Developer Frank Newton about how to make a patchwork quilt from old tech conference t-shirts. I started my quilt that very conference and this year it's finally finished."

"People used to come to NodeCamp because they liked node," said Linton Giles, organiser of the 2015 camp. "These days we have people coming to camp that don't even know what node is. We have people doing all sorts of things: playing sports, learning to play guitar, reading books. This year, there was a guy balancing plates on his head and another training his parrot to fly through hoops of fire."

"It makes organisation so much easier," Giles said, "I don't have to book speakers anymore, this year I didn't even have to hire catering as there was a group of people that were learning to cook so they just fed everyone."

With the quilt finally finished, Hume speaks of his plans for next year, "There are so many things I've been wanting to hack on. Learning French, building a sand castle, baking a cake from scratch. Luckily I have RailsCamp, CampJS and PythonCamp coming up so plenty of time to work on them."
