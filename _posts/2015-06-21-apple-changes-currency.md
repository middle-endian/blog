Basic apps now cost "1/3 of a coffee", while more advanced apps are usually "1 coffee". We have seen some very complex games labels as "1 caramel frappucino", but these are quite rare in the App Store.

"I never realised apps were so cheap. Since the new pricing model, I found that I usuall buy 3 apps a day. Sometimes 3 apps in the morning, and another 3 in the afternoon if I need a small break."
