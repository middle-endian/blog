## Creating articles

All blog posts are written using standard [Github flavoured Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) documents.
The only requirements are:

- they must contain `YAML` metadata at the top
- they must follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` naming convention

Draft are stored under [_drafts](https://github.com/TabDigital/TabDigital.github.io/tree/master/_drafts).
These do not get published, but can be previewed in the local server.

Published posts are stored under [_posts](https://github.com/TabDigital/TabDigital.github.io/tree/master/_posts).
You can also add the `indexed: false` flag to any of them,
in which case the article will be published, but not indexed on the front page.
This is useful for last-minute checks, as you can give the (secret) link to anyone for final review.
